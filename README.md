A set of 20-minute talks and exercises for **noob hour** at PDXScala. The goal is to have a set of fill-in exercises with predefined tests, so we can talk through the subject and everyone can fill in code as we go.

So far there are exercises and tests for:

* `fold/` - an introduction to folding over lists (no slides yet, but see http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7810909/media/doc/list-folds.pdf for inspiration.
* `constraints/` - using type constraints. Slides included.

Ideas:

* Variance
