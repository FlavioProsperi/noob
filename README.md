A set of 20-minute talks and exercises for **noob hour** at PDXScala. The goal is to have a set of fill-in exercises with predefined tests, so we can talk through the subject and everyone can fill in code as we go.

So far there are exercises and tests (but no slides) for:

* `fold/` - an introduction to folding over lists.
* `evidence/` - using type constraints.
